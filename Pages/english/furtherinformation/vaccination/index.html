	<h2>Health Guarantee?</h2>
	<p>For God did not give us the spirit of fear,<br />but of power and love and self-control. <br />

	<h2>BASIC THOUGHTS ON ILLNESSES</h2>
	<p>Every illness (infectious or not) is an expression, a specific picture for some disorder inside me.</p>
	<p>The moment I consciously or unconsciously suppress the physiological processes in my body or mind, I step out of the physiological process-flow. My organism must then react with some energetic or physical shifting in order to keep the balance in the whole system = quant.</p>

	<h2>A symptom develops!!!</h2>
	<p>All of my symptoms develop in a certain manner that is typical for me (constitutional nature!)</p>
	<p>I virtually wait for the right impulse from outside (z. B. tick, virus, bacteria, etc.), to develop  the reaction I need to regain my central balance. It doesn’t really matter, how severe the illness is.</p>
	<p>EVERY FUNCTION THAT HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED AND IS NOT LIVED MUST BE LIVED = DEVELOPMENT OF SYMPTOMS.</p>
	<p>A FUNCTION = MY LIFE I MUST LIVE, MY TASK, CAN’T BE SUPPRESSED OR INTERRUPTED!!!</p>
	<h2>VACCINATION:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Transmission of some specific information</li>
		<li>If it isn’t my theme, it isn’t interesting for me</li>
		<li>This illness is of no INTER-EST to me</li>
		<li>But if it meets my INTER-EST, already this weakened IN-FORM-ATION is enough to provoke an according answer in me.</li>
	</ul>
