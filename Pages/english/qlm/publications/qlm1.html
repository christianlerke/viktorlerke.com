<h1>Quantum Logic Medicine 1</h1>
<p>Health for body, mind and soul</p>
<p>a utopian idea?</p>
<p>- an unattainable goal of modern medicine?</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 48% of all people are chronically, that means incurably ill. And despite our highly scientific and expensive medicine, a further increase up to 60% is to be expected during the next few years. This alarming development affects all age-groups. We seem to be unable to cure common diseases like neurodermtitis, allergies, internal diseases, musculoskeletal complaints and many others, not to mention mental and psychosomatic illnesses.</p>
<p>In conventional medicine, we cling to the old views and theories which say that you must isolate, scrutinize and finally destroy a patient's symptoms by all means available, like antibiotics, analgetics (painkillers), antiphlogistics (anti-inflammatory drugs) etc. The only aim is to get rid of the symptoms, which is regarded as „healing“. It doesn't seem necessary to look at the patient's personal situation or to search for a possible cause of the disease.</p>
<p>At the same time, our achievements in technology are incredible. In surgery and emergency care (mechanistic medicine) for example, there are nearly no limits to technological perfection. But by concentrating on the details, we have lost the view of the coherence of all things. Our personal relations become poorer and poorer, a growing sense of individualism and egoism affects our families, friendships and work life.</p>
<p>Of course we are not happy with this situation and try to find a way out. And so we look for new strategies that promise us a better life (therapies, philisophies). Many of us count on the development of new testing procedures and appliances to guarantee health and a long life.</p>
<p>But no therapy that ignores a person in his wholeness, with all his special characteristics, his feelings and motives can ever be successful.</p>
<p>That's just what „quantumlogic medicine“ is about. This very advanced and scientific field of medicine uses the laws and insight of quantum theory and quantum logic to better understand one of the oldest medical sciences – the classical homeopathy. Quantum logic medicine makes it easier to use the enormous amount of knowledge and experience of classical homeopathy, which is based on the exact observation of a person's characteristics and pathologies and updates it at the same time. </p>
<p>In addition to that, quantumlogic medicine uses the insights and experience of Traditional Chinese Medicine to understand bodily symptoms. Above all, it is important to see the energetic connection between the human body, his organs and his mind, which is only reluctantly recognized in conventional medicine.</p>
<p>This combination enables us for the first time in the history of medicine to understand the symptoms of a patient, his disease, as a unique expression of his existence and to find out his personal characteristics. Only with this knowledge we can heal serious physical and mental pathologies.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, one of Sigmund Freud's students, also pursued the idea of wholeness. His insights play an important role in quantumlogic medicine.</p>
<p>The German physician and scientist Prof. Dr. Walter Köster holds the chair of quantumlogic medicine (quantumlogic homeopathy) at the University of Seville. After years of research he was able to combine all the knowledge of Far Eastern Medicine, Classical Homeopathy, psychology and quantum logic. Supported by Prof. C. F. von Weizsäcker (physicist and philosopher), he has integrated the physics of the 21st century in medicine and made it teachable.</p>
<p>Many holistic thinking people are fascinated by this subject. The more you learn about the deeper connections, the less you have to be afraid of serious diseases that threaten our existence. The incurability of illnesses becomes relative. And you learn to live in harmony with yourself and your fellow men.</p>
<p>As this topic is very complex, it is neccessary to talk about some basics first. Therefore I'd like to introduce the principles of classical homeopathy and acupuncture in the following editions, and talk about our today's logic, the logic after Aristotle. Then I'm going to compare it with quantum theory and quantum logic. Mixed with some examples from my pratice, I think it will be very interesting!</span></p>
