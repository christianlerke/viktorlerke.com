<h1>Quantum Logic Medicine 3</h1>
<p>Last time I wrote about Classical Homeopathy, on which Quantum Logic Medicine is based. Today I'm going to introduce another key component – the acupuncture. For every illness there is an original cause and you can only find this cause by understanding the different symptoms and their connection. A therapist must be able to see how the symptoms and complaints of his patient are related (what has his allergy to do with his haemorrhoids?), because only then he can really understand his patient's situation. Or as Richard von Weizsäcker (one of the originators of Quantum Logic Medicine) said: „to understand is to know what something means“. A diagnosis like „irritable bowel syndrome“ tells you that your bowel function is disturbed, but that's all. Is your whole existence limited to this one disbalance? I've been practising as a doctor for more than 18 years now, but I've never seen only the colon, the body or the soul of a patient coming into my practice. It has ALWAYS been the whole person – an inseparable unit of body, mind and soul. In classical medicine, however, we still disregard this unit and look at every organ and function separately. That's why we have so many specialists! The psychologist helps your mind, the internist helps your stomach and for your tonsils please see an ENT specialist.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine, of which Acupuncture is one of the main elements, is an experience-based medicine. Already 4000 years ago, scripts existed which described how the diffent parts of the body are related. These connections picture the different meridians, so-called memory lines. It is a closed, energetic system. Five function circles (12 meridian pairs) form the basis of this system. They are named after the corresponding organ pair (Yang- and Yin-organ). The according meridian pair flows through these organs and defines their function. For example lung – colon: the function of these organs is absorbtion, product forming and excretion. The two organs are also known as excretory organs. Things that cannot be digested must be excreted. All areas of the body which are flown through by the according meridian belong to this function circle. In our example it is the pointing finger, thumb, thumb-sided lower and upper arm (tennis elbow), anterior shoulder capsule (shoulder-arm syndrome), lateral neck up to the nasal angle. The according tissue – in our example skin and mucous membrane of the upper respiratory system. That means, diseases that manifest on the skin or the mucous membrane show an energetic connection to the function of the defense organs lung and colon (e. g. neurodermatitis, other multiple allergies, problems with the paranasal sinus = weakened defense system). Further, to every function circle there belongs an „opener organ“ that makes the function of the according system visible. In our example it is the nose, that means diseases of the lung or colon can express themselves in diseases of the nose. The other way round, diseases of the nose or paranasal sinus can suggest some disorder of the lung or colon function. The meridian pair also flows through the according teeth with the appentant anatomic structures, like gums etc. In our example, they are the molars = grinders, where the digestion begins AND which stand for chewing over something. The weather and the seasons of the year are another vital element of the function circle. In our example, it's autumn, the crucial season for the organism because it is the interim period between warmth and cold (even in air-conditioned rooms). It's the classic weakening of the defense system. The mind is another essential element of the function circle. In our example it's the time of parting that belongs to autumn, after the peak of life. Summer with its many flowers and brightness is over, the fruit is ripe and now it's time to let go (the function of the colon and the lung – expiration). If you are not able to let go, no matter in which area of life, it's very likely that some disbalance will occur in the according organ system (colon/lung), e. g. constipation, asthma etc. The other way round, any disease affecting the above mentioned organ system points to some inability to let go.</p>
<p>This system enables the therapist to see the coherence between his patient's different symptoms and thus chooses the right therapy for him. A clearly connected picture of the person with all his mental and physical characeristics becomes visible (CONTEXT). This context is the permanent element that characterizes a person at any stage of his life, from childhood to old age.</p>
<p>I'd like to tell you about a case from practice:</p>
<p>A mother came to my practice with her 10-year-old son. He'd had an increasing, itching and blistering rash in the face, at the side of the nose for about 2 weeks. She was very worried about it and had already treated the rash herself with a light cortisone ointment but without success. The boy had no other complaints. The described rash proved itself to be herpes (fever blisters).</p>
<p>The location of the rash was interesting, because the colon meridian ends exactly at the affected spot, directly at the side of the nose. You know about the function of the colon: it excretes everything which is of no use. It discards everything I must get rid of to avoid congestion. So I asked the boy if he had any problems at school or at home. He said “no”, but, his bowel movements had been painful and the stool had been very hard since the same time that the rash had appeared. Later he told me that there had been a problem with his arts teacher at school. The boy had considered a task given by his teacher stupid and therefore rejected it. Consequently the teacher gave him a bad mark. The boy said he wouldn’t care, because he had only top marks in his report anyway, but because of this stupid situation he would now only get a B in arts. He was furious about that and had also talked a lot about it at home.</p>
<p>For a better understanding of the situation:</p>
<p>The boy had received a bad mark because of his stubbornness. He couldn’t “digest” and “remove” it, as to say get rid of it. Therefore he developed retention of faeces (constipation) and at the same time an itching and blistering rash. But where? Exactly at the end of the colon meridian, where the removal should take place. As if his body tried to tell him: “Look, you have kept something that should already be gone. If you refuse to clear this situation, I will act for you as an herpetic skin rash, form blisters (independent, self-contained life) and cause itching to get your attention until you finally understand the situation and clear it. After analysis and prescription of a specific homeopathic remedy which was his constitutional remedy at the same time, both the skin rash and retention of faeces were cured within three days.</p>
