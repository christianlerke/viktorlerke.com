<p>CLASSICAL HOMEOPATHY</p>
<p>„The physician's highest calling, his only calling, is to make sick people healthy – to heal, as it is termed.“</p>
<p>Quoted from Samuel Hahnemann, founder of homeopathy in the „Organon of Medicine, §1“</p>
<p>As already announced in the last issue, I'd like to tell you about the basics of „Quantumlogic Medicine“ today.</p>
<p>The founder of classical homeopathy, Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, was born on 10th April 1755 in the town of Meißen in Saxony. He was the third of five children of a porcelain painter. After completing school in his town, he was admitted to the prince's school St. Afra. „Aude sapere“ (dare to know) was the motto of the school. When he was twenty he began his study of medicine in Leipzig and Vienna, accompanied by studies of pharmacy and chemistry. After his dissertation at the age of 24, he started his own practice. In 1781, he married Henriette Küchler, the pharmacist's stepdaughter.</p>
<p>Hahnemann translated works on chemistry into English and wrote some of his own books about veneral diseases and intoxications. In several letters to a friend he wrote disappointed about „medicine that is reduced to repressing symptoms and trading recipes“ (very much like today's medicine!) Finally, he gave up his practice and earned the living for his five-member family by doing translations. He worked through every other night.</p>
<p>The similarity (the „simile“)</p>
<p>In 1790, he started to translate a work on the effectiveness of cinchona bark with malaria. Thereby he noticed that cinchona bark can cause an „artificial fever which is similar to malaria“, but at the same time can heal it. That was the birth of homeopathy: a remedy can only heal if it can cause similar symptoms in a healthy person. You could say, it provoces an „artificial“ illness (the „simile“) which is like a mirror of the real illness. Thereby it shows the organism = „the dynamis“ = the vital energy the right way to healing. Until today, cinchona bark is regarded as the main remedy in the treatment and prevention of malaria. Numerous experiments and publications followed Hahnemann's discovery. Meanwhile, Hahnemann had nine children. The publication of his remedy against scarlet fever „Belladonna“ (Deadly nightshade) was followed by the introduction of further remedies like Pulsatilla, Arsenicum album, etc.</p>
<p>The discovery of potentation</p>
<p>Many of the homeopathic remedies were known as poisonous, so it was unthinkable to administer them to an ill person. Diluting the substances would make them less toxic, but at the same time they would lose much of their effect. An accidental discovery helped Hahnemann out of this dilemma. He noticed that dilution combined with vigorous shaking enhanced the effectiveness of a substance, while it became less toxic. This was the big breakthrough in the production of homeopathic remedies.</p>
<p>Hahnemann eventually took up his medical practice again, but this time as a homeopathic doctor. In 1810, he published the „Organon of Medicine“ which contains 291 paragraphes that define the principles of homeopathic treatment. Moreover, he became lecturer at the university.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, a typhus epidemic broke out. Hahnemann treated the sick with three different remedies and only one patient out of 180 died. After that, his practice flourished, but soon the local pharmacists began zu rebel against him. Finally he had to leave Leipzig. The following years were very hard for him and his family, because of the permanent conflicts with colleagues and pharmacists.</p>
<p>In 1828, meanwhile 78 years old, he wrote one of his main works: „Chronic diseases, their unique nature and homeopathic healing“. One year later, he celebrated his golden doctor's anniversary. 400 pupils came together and founded the „Society of homeopathic doctors“. In 1830, Henriette, his wife, died of a malign liver tumor. </p>
<p>Hahnemann became increasingly hostile towards his colleagues. He saw that most of them didn't try very hard to find the right remedies, but preferred to treat their patients with combination remedies. Hahnemann began to fight them, called them „bastards“, as they ruined the original, pure homeopathy. (Not very different from today!)</p>
<p>In 1834, a young lady of 30 years, called Melanie d'Hervilly-Gohier, came from Paris to seek treatment for a „Tic doloreux“. She was very interested in Hahnemann's work and learned a lot. One year later, they got married. Hahnemann was 80 years old at that time. They moved to Paris, and there he was treated with more honour and respect than ever before. He had a luxory practice and founded a polyclinic, where the poor were treated free of charge.</p>
<p>Hahneman became an elegant old gentleman. He developed a great certainty in finding the right remedy and possessed great wisdom. In 1843, he celebrated his 88th birthday. The following day he got a persistent inflammation of the trachea. Three months later, on the 2nd of July 1843, Hahnemann died.</p>
<p>His work „CLASSICAL HOMEOPATHY“ survived various epochs in medicine. It couldn't be destroyed despite the permanent animosity of conventional medicine. Its strength was and still is the observation of the person in his wholeness, with all his characterstics, emotions and symptoms.</p>
