		<h1>Quantum Logic Medicine</h1>
		<p>Quantumlogic Medicine is a very new and progressive scientific field of medicine, which uses the laws and knowledge of Quantum theory and Quantum logic to explain and update one of the oldest practical medicines, the Classical Homeopathy.</p>
		<p>In addition to that, Quantumlogic Medicine uses the knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern psychology. This combination which is unique in the history of medicine gives us the chance to understand the patient’s symptoms (his illness) as a certain expression of his existence. At the same time we can see the same person’s permanent characteristics and thereby identify the appropriate remedy which can then heal even severe diseases.</p>
		<p>Prof. Dr. Walter Köster holds the chair of Quantumlogic Medicine (Quantumlogic Homeopathy) at the University of Seville. I finished my degree with him personally.</p>
		<p>In my experience (several years of lecturing), many holistic thinking people are very interested in this field of medicine, because once they have understood its procedure, they usually lose their fear and panic of severe illnesses and they can start to meet their fellow men on a much healthier and more loving level.</p>
		<p>As Quantumlogic Medicine is a huge field, it has to be presented in single steps and with some example cases to make it comprehensible. Therefore I will write short coordinated essays that are easily understood at regular intervals and I will readily answer any arising questions.</p>
