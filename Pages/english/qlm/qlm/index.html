		<p>"Understanding is knowing what it means”<br />
			Prof. C.F. Freiherr von Weizsäcker</p>
		<p>This statement from the "founding father" of Quantum Logic Medicine, Prof. CF Freiherr von Weizsäcker, has become a guiding principle. For neither in conventional medicine nor in classical homeopathy, we - as physicians - have learned, to look beyond the various symptoms to understand the larger context. To date, these symptoms were considered as facts that occur randomly and which had to be removed as quickly as possible.</p>
		<p>Thus, we physicians had only one target: the destruction of pathogenic symptoms. In order to keep up with the complexity and wealth of variations of individual diseases, multiple Ana-lyses (separations) had to be performed. Through the intense preoccupation with the individual symptoms, we neglected the broader context and finally lost that context completely out of sight.</p>
		<p>Thus, the work of a doctor was equated to that of a technician. The mechanics and their logic (after Aristotle) "won the race."</p>
		<p>We achieve great success in surgery and emergency medicine (mechanics), fail, however, increasingly in treating everyday ailments and in treating nearly all diseases.</p>
		<p>The rate of incurability = the chronicity is now estimated at more than 50% of the European population by the WHO.</p>
		<p>Only when one considers the diagnoses no longer as single, independent facts but tries to understand what's going on with the affected person ("what's really going on there") and understands the dynamics of the development of the various diseases, then one gains an insight into the real relationships, "entanglement" = "interwoven-ness" =  “TWISTS” = CONTEXT of the person (from the Latin Contexo "to weave together, to put together," and contextus "intertwined, continuous").</p>
		<p>This way a very specific overall context = QUANT is being uncovered inseparably linking and interweaving all statements of an individual in a unique and relevant manner. This quant belongs to that very person and does not change throughout one’s life.</p>
		<p>Thus, the greatest work has already been done, because the unchangeable quant has been discovered.</p>
		<p>Now the appropriate Quantum Logic remedy has to be selected that matches the overall context of the patient in order to strengthen the ailing entanglement (the disturbed context?), to strengthen the declining inter-Esse, to "repair" it. Thus, all functions of the patient integrate better in a holistic way. The patient functions better. His interest (= Inter-Esse) for life in general can be lived again.</p>
		<p>To understand a human being, one needs, especially the interest (Inter-Esse) to do this, the know-how and time.</p>
		<p>This can very well be accomplished in a personal case history of approximately 1.5 hours, but it can also easily be done in a virtual setting (via Skype) in the same time.</p>
		<p>In parallel, the analysis and differentiation takes place by myself personally.</p>
		<p>The administration of the remedy or shipment thereof complete the medical case history.</p>
		<p>After a subsequent 3-4 week observation phase, we get in touch again (in person, via e-mail, Skype or phone) to gather information about the healing process and to be guided on how to proceed.</p>
		<p>The goal of the case history lays in understanding the actual process, the context of the patient, which expresses itself both in the symptoms and in each of his gestures and his every thought.</p>
		<p>Proven knowledge can only be gained once there is understanding according to Weizsäcker.</p>
		<p>Acting is merely the conclusion.</p>
		<p>From my personal experience a treatment via Skype is easily possible, if you meet the above mentioned prerequisites.</p>
